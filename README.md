# Predictive Maintenance Web App

This project uses a Random Forest model to predict machine failure based on sensor data. The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Features
- Interactive UI to input sensor values.
- Real-time failure prediction with probability.
- Model explanations using SHAP to understand the "why" behind each prediction.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
